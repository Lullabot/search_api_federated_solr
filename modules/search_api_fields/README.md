# Fields Search API Module

This module facilitates indexing data from multiple Drupal sites into a single Solr search index.

On each site included in the mapped field search, you will need to:

1. Install this module
2. Configure a Search API server to connect to the shared Solr index
3. Configure a Search API index according to the [recommended schema](docs/mapped_fields_schema.md)
